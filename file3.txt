Both Git and GitHub is important for several reasons:

1. Version control with Git: Git enables developers to track changes in source code over time. It makes it easy to revert to previous versions of the code if needed and to collaborate with other developers.

2. Collaboration and sharing with GitHub: GitHub is a cloud-based platform for version control built on top of Git. By using GitHub, developers can easily share their projects, collaborate with others, and manage their codebase.

3. Open source and community: GitHub is a major platform for open source, meaning developers from around the world can share and contribute to projects. This fosters collaboration, innovation, and knowledge sharing within the developer community.

4. Project management: GitHub offers various tools and features for project management, such as issue trackers, pull requests, and project boards. These tools facilitate planning, collaboration, and tracking of work within a project.
