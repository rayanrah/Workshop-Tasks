What is GitHub?

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform built on top of Git.

It provides hosting for Git repositories and adds additional features such as bug tracking, task management, and wikis.

GitHub allows users to store their Git repositories in the cloud, making it easy to collaborate with others, contribute to open-source projects, and share code with the wider community. 

It's widely used by developers and organizations for managing and sharing code, tracking issues, and collaborating on projects.
