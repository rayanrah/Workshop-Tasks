What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. 

It allows users to collaborate on projects efficiently by keeping track of changes, managing different versions of files, and facilitating collaboration between team members. 

Git is commonly used in software development but can also be useful for managing any type of text-based files.
